A ccoommppuutteerr is a general purpose device that can be _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_e_d to carry out a
set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be
readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element,
typically a _c_e_n_t_r_a_l_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g_ _u_n_i_t (CPU) and some form of _m_e_m_o_r_y. The
processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a
sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on
stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from
an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.
In _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_a_r_ _I_I, _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l _a_n_a_l_o_g_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s were used for specialized military
applications. During this time the first electronic _d_i_g_i_t_a_l computers were
developed. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much
power as several hundred modern _p_e_r_s_o_n_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s (PCs)._[_1_]
Modern computers based on _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_e_d_ _c_i_r_c_u_i_t_s are millions to billions of times
more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space._[_2_]
Simple computers are small enough to fit into _m_o_b_i_l_e_ _d_e_v_i_c_e_s, and _m_o_b_i_l_e
_c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s can be powered by small _b_a_t_t_e_r_i_e_s. Personal computers in their
various forms are _i_c_o_n_s of the _I_n_f_o_r_m_a_t_i_o_n_ _A_g_e and are what most people think
of as ‚Äúcomputers.‚Äù However, the _e_m_b_e_d_d_e_d_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s found in many devices
from _M_P_3_ _p_l_a_y_e_r_s to _f_i_g_h_t_e_r_ _a_i_r_c_r_a_f_t and from toys to _i_n_d_u_s_t_r_i_a_l_ _r_o_b_o_t_s are the
most numerous.

The first use of the word ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù was recorded in 1613 in a book called
‚ÄúThe yong mans gleanings‚Äù by English writer Richard Braithwait I haue read
the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer breathed,
and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number. It referred to a person who
carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued with the same
meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century
the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out
computations._[_3_]

Although rudimentary calculating devices first appeared in antiquity and
mechanical calculating aids were invented in the 17th century, the first
'computers' were conceived of in the 19th century, and only emerged in their
modern form in the 1940s.

_C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _B_a_b_b_a_g_e, an English mechanical engineer and _p_o_l_y_m_a_t_h, originated the
concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "_f_a_t_h_e_r_ _o_f_ _t_h_e_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r",_[_4_]
he conceptualized and invented the first _m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r in the early 19th
century. After working on his revolutionary _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_ _e_n_g_i_n_e, designed to aid
in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general
design, an _A_n_a_l_y_t_i_c_a_l_ _E_n_g_i_n_e, was possible. The input of programs and data was
to be provided to the machine via _p_u_n_c_h_e_d_ _c_a_r_d_s, a method being used at the
time to direct mechanical _l_o_o_m_s such as the _J_a_c_q_u_a_r_d_ _l_o_o_m. For output, the
machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would
also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine
incorporated an _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c_ _l_o_g_i_c_ _u_n_i_t, _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _f_l_o_w in the form of _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l
_b_r_a_n_c_h_i_n_g and _l_o_o_p_s, and integrated _m_e_m_o_r_y, making it the first design for a
general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as _T_u_r_i_n_g_-
_c_o_m_p_l_e_t_e._[_5_]_[_6_]
The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his
machine had to be made by hand - this was a major problem for a device with
thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of
the _B_r_i_t_i_s_h_ _G_o_v_e_r_n_m_e_n_t to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the
analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of
politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly
sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow.
Nevertheless his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the
analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful
demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.

During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific _c_o_m_p_u_t_i_n_g needs were
met by increasingly sophisticated _a_n_a_l_o_g_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s, which used a direct
mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for _c_o_m_p_u_t_a_t_i_o_n.
However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and
accuracy of modern digital computers._[_7_]
The first modern analog computer was a _t_i_d_e_-_p_r_e_d_i_c_t_i_n_g_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e, invented by _S_i_r
_W_i_l_l_i_a_m_ _T_h_o_m_s_o_n in 1872. The _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t_i_a_l_ _a_n_a_l_y_s_e_r, a mechanical analog
computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-
and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by _J_a_m_e_s_ _T_h_o_m_s_o_n, the brother
of the more famous Lord Kelvin._[_8_]
The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_t_i_a_l
_a_n_a_l_y_z_e_r, built by H. L. Hazen and _V_a_n_n_e_v_a_r_ _B_u_s_h at _M_I_T starting in 1927. This
built on the mechanical integrators of _J_a_m_e_s_ _T_h_o_m_s_o_n and the torque amplifiers
invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their
obsolescence became obvious.

_A_l_a_n_ _T_u_r_i_n_g was the first to conceptualize the modern computer, a device that
became known as the _U_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l_ _T_u_r_i_n_g_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e.
The principle of the modern computer was first described by _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _s_c_i_e_n_t_i_s_t
_A_l_a_n_ _T_u_r_i_n_g, who set out the idea in his seminal 1936 paper,_[_9_] On Computable
Numbers. Turing reformulated _K_u_r_t_ _G_√_∂_d_e_l's 1931 results on the limits of proof
and computation, replacing G√∂del's universal arithmetic-based formal language
with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as _T_u_r_i_n_g
_m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s. He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any
conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m.
He went on to prove that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem by
first showing that the _h_a_l_t_i_n_g_ _p_r_o_b_l_e_m for Turing machines is _u_n_d_e_c_i_d_a_b_l_e: in
general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing
machine will ever halt.
He also introduced the notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a
_U_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l_ _T_u_r_i_n_g_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e), with the idea that such a machine could perform the
tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of
computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape,
allowing the machine to be programmable. _V_o_n_ _N_e_u_m_a_n_n acknowledged that the
central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper._[_1_0_] Turing
machines are to this day a central object of study in _t_h_e_o_r_y_ _o_f_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_a_t_i_o_n.
Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern
computers are said to be _T_u_r_i_n_g_-_c_o_m_p_l_e_t_e, which is to say, they have _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m

Replica of _Z_u_s_e's _Z_3, the first fully automatic, digital (electromechanical)
computer.
Early digital computers were electromechanical - electric switches drove
mechanical relays to perform the calculation. These devices had a low operating
speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers,
originally using _v_a_c_u_u_m_ _t_u_b_e_s. The _Z_2, created by German engineer _K_o_n_r_a_d_ _Z_u_s_e
in 1939, was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay
computer._[_1_1_]
In 1941, Zuse followed his earlier machine up with the _Z_3, the world's first
working _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_m_e_c_h_a_n_i_c_a_l _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_a_b_l_e, fully automatic digital computer._[_1_2_]
_[_1_3_] The Z3 was built with 2000 _r_e_l_a_y_s, implementing a 22 _b_i_t _w_o_r_d_ _l_e_n_g_t_h that
operated at a _c_l_o_c_k_ _f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y of about 5‚Äì10 _H_z._[_1_4_] Program code and data
were stored on punched _f_i_l_m. It was quite similar to modern machines in some
respects, pioneering numerous advances such as _f_l_o_a_t_i_n_g_ _p_o_i_n_t_ _n_u_m_b_e_r_s.
Replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system (used in _C_h_a_r_l_e_s_ _B_a_b_b_a_g_e's
earlier design) by the simpler _b_i_n_a_r_y system meant that Zuse's machines were
easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available
at that time._[_1_5_] The Z3 was probably a complete _T_u_r_i_n_g_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e.

Purely _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _c_i_r_c_u_i_t elements soon replaced their mechanical and
electromechanical equivalents, at the same time that digital calculation
replaced analog. The engineer _T_o_m_m_y_ _F_l_o_w_e_r_s, working at the _P_o_s_t_ _O_f_f_i_c_e
_R_e_s_e_a_r_c_h_ _S_t_a_t_i_o_n in _D_o_l_l_i_s_ _H_i_l_l in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use
of electronics for the _t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e. Experimental equipment that he built
in 1934 went into operation 5 years later, converting a portion of the
_t_e_l_e_p_h_o_n_e_ _e_x_c_h_a_n_g_e network into an electronic data processing system, using
thousands of _v_a_c_u_u_m_ _t_u_b_e_s._[_7_] In the US, John Vincent Atanasoff and Clifford E.

_C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r (ABC) in 1942,_[_1_6_] The first electronic digital calculating device.
_[_1_7_] This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with
capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory._[_1_8_]
Colossus was the first _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c _d_i_g_i_t_a_l _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_a_b_l_e computing device, and
was used to break German ciphers during World War II.
During World War II, the British at _B_l_e_t_c_h_l_e_y_ _P_a_r_k achieved a number of
successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German
encryption machine, _E_n_i_g_m_a, was first attacked with the help of the electro-
mechanical _b_o_m_b_e_s. To crack the more sophisticated German _L_o_r_e_n_z_ _S_Z_ _4_0_/_4_2
machine, used for high-level Army communications, _M_a_x_ _N_e_w_m_a_n and his colleagues
commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus._[_1_8_] He spent eleven months from
early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus._[_1_9_] After a
functional test in December 1943, Colossus was shipped to Bletchley Park, where
it was delivered on 18 January 1944_[_2_0_] and attacked its first message on 5
February._[_1_8_]
Colossus was the world's first _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c _d_i_g_i_t_a_l _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_a_b_l_e computer._[_7_] It
used a large number of valves (vacuum tubes). It had paper-tape input and was
capable of being configured to perform a variety of _b_o_o_l_e_a_n_ _l_o_g_i_c_a_l operations
on its data, but it was not _T_u_r_i_n_g_-_c_o_m_p_l_e_t_e. Nine Mk II Colossi were built (The
Mk I was converted to a Mk II making ten machines in total). Colossus Mark I
contained 1500 thermionic valves (tubes), but Mark II with 2400 valves, was
both 5 times faster and simpler to operate than Mark 1, greatly speeding the
decoding process._[_2_1_]_[_2_2_]
_E_N_I_A_C was the first Turing-complete device,and performed ballistics trajectory
calculations for the _U_n_i_t_e_d_ _S_t_a_t_e_s_ _A_r_m_y.
The US-built _E_N_I_A_C (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) was the first
electronic programmable computer built in the US. Although the ENIAC was
similar to the Colossus it was much faster and more flexible. It was
unambiguously a Turing-complete device and could compute any problem that would
fit into its memory. Like the Colossus, a "program" on the ENIAC was defined by
the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the _s_t_o_r_e_d_ _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be
mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches.
It combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for
many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand
times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide,
and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes).
Built under the direction of _J_o_h_n_ _M_a_u_c_h_l_y and _J_._ _P_r_e_s_p_e_r_ _E_c_k_e_r_t at the
University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from
1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30
tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum
tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and
inductors._[_2_3_]

Early computing machines had fixed programs. Changing its function required the
re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine._[_1_8_] With the proposal of the
stored-program computer this changed. A stored-program computer includes by
design an _i_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_ _s_e_t and can store in memory a set of instructions (a
_p_r_o_g_r_a_m) that details the _c_o_m_p_u_t_a_t_i_o_n. The theoretical basis for the stored-
program computer was laid by _A_l_a_n_ _T_u_r_i_n_g in his 1936 paper. In 1945 Turing
joined the _N_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_ _P_h_y_s_i_c_a_l_ _L_a_b_o_r_a_t_o_r_y and began work on developing an

its first program on 21 June 1948._[_2_4_] It was designed as a _t_e_s_t_b_e_d for the

computer was considered "small and primitive" by the standards of its time, it
was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a
modern electronic computer._[_2_6_] As soon as the SSEM had demonstrated the
feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop
it into a more usable computer, the _M_a_n_c_h_e_s_t_e_r_ _M_a_r_k_ _1.

The bipolar _t_r_a_n_s_i_s_t_o_r was invented in 1947. From 1955 onwards transistors
replaced _v_a_c_u_u_m_ _t_u_b_e_s in computer designs, giving rise to the "second
generation" of computers. Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many
advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give
off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum
tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life. Transistorized computers could
contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact
space.

designed and built a machine using the newly developed _t_r_a_n_s_i_s_t_o_r_s instead of

concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the
first working integrated example on 12 September 1958._[_3_6_] In his patent
application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as ‚Äúa body of
semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit
are completely integrated.‚Äù_[_3_7_] Noyce also came up with his own idea of an
integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby._[_3_8_] His chip solved many
practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor,
it was made of _s_i_l_i_c_o_n, whereas Kilby's chip was made of _g_e_r_m_a_n_i_u_m.

of computers and led to the invention of the _m_i_c_r_o_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r. While the subject
of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due
to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term "microprocessor", it
is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel

The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all
other machines is that they can be _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_e_d. That is to say that some type of
_i_n_s_t_r_u_c_t_i_o_n_s (the _p_r_o_g_r_a_m) can be given to the computer, and it will process
them. Modern computers based on the _v_o_n_ _N_e_u_m_a_n_n_ _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e often have machine
code in the form of an _i_m_p_e_r_a_t_i_v_e_ _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e.
In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend
to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for _w_o_r_d_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_s and
_w_e_b_ _b_r_o_w_s_e_r_s for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of
instructions per second (_g_i_g_a_f_l_o_p_s) and rarely makes a mistake over many years
of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million
instructions may take teams of _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_e_r_s years to write, and due to the
complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

This section applies to most common _R_A_M_ _m_a_c_h_i_n_e-based computers.
In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another,
move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external
device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's _m_e_m_o_r_y and are
generally carried out (_e_x_e_c_u_t_e_d) in the order they were given. However, there
are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or
backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from
there. These are called ‚Äújump‚Äù instructions (or _b_r_a_n_c_h_e_s). Furthermore,
jump instructions may be made to happen _c_o_n_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l_l_y so that different
sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous
calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support _s_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s
by providing a type of jump that ‚Äúremembers‚Äù the location it jumped from
and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump
instruction.
Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will
normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an
earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly,
a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of
the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is
called the _f_l_o_w_ _o_f_ _c_o_n_t_r_o_l within the program and it is what allows the
computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.
Comparatively, a person using a pocket _c_a_l_c_u_l_a_t_o_r can perform a basic
arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses.
But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of
button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On
the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple
instructions. For example:
      mov No. 0, sum     ; set sum to 0
      mov No. 1, num     ; set num to 1
loop: add num, sum    ; add num to sum
      add No. 1, num     ; add 1 to num
      cmp num, #1000  ; compare num to 1000
      ble loop        ; if num <= 1000, go back to 'loop'
      halt            ; end of program. stop running
Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive
addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a
mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in about a millionth of a second.

The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard
Mark II computer
Errors in computer programs are called ‚Äú_b_u_g_s.‚Äù They may be benign and not
affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some
cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to ‚Äú_h_a_n_g,‚Äù becoming
unresponsive to input such as _m_o_u_s_e clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail,
or to _c_r_a_s_h. Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious
intent by an unscrupulous user writing an _e_x_p_l_o_i_t, code designed to take
advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually
not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions
they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an
oversight made in the program's design._[_4_2_]

In most computers, individual instructions are stored as _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_ _c_o_d_e with each
instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or _o_p_c_o_d_e for
short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the
command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on. The simplest
computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the
more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique
numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can
also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire
programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as
lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the
same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the
computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von
Neumann, or stored program, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store
some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it
operates on. This is called the _H_a_r_v_a_r_d_ _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e after the _H_a_r_v_a_r_d_ _M_a_r_k_ _I
computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard
architecture in their designs, such as in _C_P_U_ _c_a_c_h_e_s.
While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers
(_m_a_c_h_i_n_e_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e) and while this technique was used with many early computers,
_[_4_4_] it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice,
especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be
given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember ‚Äì
a _m_n_e_m_o_n_i_c such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively
known as a computer's _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_y_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e. Converting programs written in
assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine
language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.

Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers
to run. Unlike _n_a_t_u_r_a_l_ _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e_s, programming languages are designed to permit
no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often
difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_ _c_o_d_e
by a _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r or an _a_s_s_e_m_b_l_e_r before being run, or translated directly at run
time by an _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_r. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of
the two techniques.

Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively
termed low-level programming languages) tend to be unique to a particular type
of computer. For instance, an _A_R_M_ _a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e computer (such as may be found

Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in
assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most
practical programs are written in more abstract _h_i_g_h_-_l_e_v_e_l_ _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g

conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages
are usually ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù into machine language (or sometimes into assembly
language and then into machine language) using another computer program called
a _c_o_m_p_i_l_e_r._[_4_6_] High level languages are less related to the workings of the
target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and
structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore
often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level
language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.

Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis
of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within
languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing
data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems
become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal
documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are
encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more
require formal software methodologies. The task of developing large _s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e
systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with
an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has
historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of
_s_o_f_t_w_a_r_e_ _e_n_g_i_n_e_e_r_i_n_g concentrates specifically on this challenge.

Video demonstrating the standard components of a "slimline" computer
A general purpose computer has four main components: the _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c_ _l_o_g_i_c_ _u_n_i_t
(ALU), the _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _u_n_i_t, the _m_e_m_o_r_y, and the input and output devices
(collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by _b_u_s_e_s, often made
of groups of _w_i_r_e_s.
Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small _e_l_e_c_t_r_i_c_a_l
_c_i_r_c_u_i_t_s which can be turned off or on by means of an _e_l_e_c_t_r_o_n_i_c_ _s_w_i_t_c_h. Each
circuit represents a _b_i_t (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit
is on it represents a ‚Äú1‚Äù, and when off it represents a ‚Äú0‚Äù (in
positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in _l_o_g_i_c_ _g_a_t_e_s so
that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the
other circuits.
The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I/O (and often other hardware
closely linked with these) are collectively known as a _c_e_n_t_r_a_l_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g_ _u_n_i_t
(CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-
1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single _i_n_t_e_g_r_a_t_e_d_ _c_i_r_c_u_i_t
called a _m_i_c_r_o_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r.

by the control system
The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages
the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the
program instructions, transforming them into a series of control signals which
activate other parts of the computer._[_4_7_] Control systems in advanced computers
may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance.
A key component common to all CPUs is the _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_ _c_o_u_n_t_e_r, a special memory
cell (a _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r) that keeps track of which location in memory the next
instruction is to be read from._[_4_8_]
The control system's function is as follows‚Äînote that this is a simplified
description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a
different order depending on the type of CPU:
   1. Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the
      program counter.
   2. Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or
      signals for each of the other systems.
   3. Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
   4. Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or
      perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is
      typically stored within the instruction code.
   5. Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
   6. If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete,
      instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
   7. Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register
      or perhaps an output device.
   8. Jump back to step (1).
Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells,
it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program
counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations
further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are
often known as ‚Äújumps‚Äù and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated
by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of
_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _f_l_o_w).
The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an
instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some
more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a
_m_i_c_r_o_s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_r, which runs a _m_i_c_r_o_c_o_d_e program that causes all of these events
to happen.

The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and
logic._[_4_9_]
The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited
to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division,
_t_r_i_g_o_n_o_m_e_t_r_y functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and _s_q_u_a_r_e_ _r_o_o_t_s. Some can
only operate on whole numbers (_i_n_t_e_g_e_r_s) whilst others use _f_l_o_a_t_i_n_g_ _p_o_i_n_t to
represent _r_e_a_l_ _n_u_m_b_e_r_s, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer
that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to
break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform.
Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic
operation‚Äîalthough it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not
directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return
_b_o_o_l_e_a_n_ _t_r_u_t_h_ _v_a_l_u_e_s (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to,

_M_a_g_n_e_t_i_c_ _c_o_r_e_ _m_e_m_o_r_y was the computer memory of choice throughout the 1960s,
until it was replaced by semiconductor memory.
A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be
placed or read. Each cell has a numbered ‚Äúaddress‚Äù and can store a single
number. The computer can be instructed to ‚Äúput the number 123 into the cell
numbered 1357‚Äù or to ‚Äúadd the number that is in cell 1357 to the number
that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.‚Äù The information
stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even
computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU
does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the
software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as
nothing but a series of numbers.
In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store _b_i_n_a_r_y
_n_u_m_b_e_r_s in groups of eight bits (called a _b_y_t_e). Each byte is able to represent
256 different numbers (2^8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or ‚àí128 to +127. To
store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two,
four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in
_t_w_o_'_s_ _c_o_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not
seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can
store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically.
Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.
The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r_s that can be
read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are
typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU.
Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to
access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being
worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow
compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.
Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties: _r_a_n_d_o_m_-_a_c_c_e_s_s_ _m_e_m_o_r_y or
RAM and _r_e_a_d_-_o_n_l_y_ _m_e_m_o_r_y or ROM. RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU
commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes,
therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the
computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are
erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data
indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the _B_I_O_S
that orchestrates loading the computer's _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g_ _s_y_s_t_e_m from the hard disk
drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In _e_m_b_e_d_d_e_d
_c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required
software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called _f_i_r_m_w_a_r_e,
because it is notionally more like hardware than software. _F_l_a_s_h_ _m_e_m_o_r_y blurs
the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but
is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM
however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is
unnecessary._[_5_1_]
In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM _c_a_c_h_e_ _m_e_m_o_r_i_e_s,
which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally
computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data
into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on
the programmer's part.

_H_a_r_d_ _d_i_s_k_ _d_r_i_v_e_s are common storage devices used with computers.
I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside
world._[_5_2_] Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called
_p_e_r_i_p_h_e_r_a_l_s._[_5_3_] On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input
devices like the keyboard and _m_o_u_s_e, and output devices such as the _d_i_s_p_l_a_y and
_p_r_i_n_t_e_r. _H_a_r_d_ _d_i_s_k_ _d_r_i_v_e_s, _f_l_o_p_p_y_ _d_i_s_k_ _d_r_i_v_e_s and _o_p_t_i_c_a_l_ _d_i_s_c_ _d_r_i_v_e_s serve as
both input and output devices. _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k_i_n_g is another form of I/O.
I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU
and memory. A _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s_ _p_r_o_c_e_s_s_i_n_g_ _u_n_i_t might contain fifty or more tiny

While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its
main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running
several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having
the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn._[_5_4_]
One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t,
which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where
it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing
prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several
programs are running ‚Äúat the same time,‚Äù then the interrupt generator might
be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each
time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of
magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are
running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given
instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed ‚Äútime-sharing‚Äù
since each program is allocated a ‚Äúslice‚Äù of time in turn._[_5_5_]
Before the era of cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to
allow many people to share the same computer.
Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between
several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of
programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for
slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for
the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not
take a ‚Äútime slice‚Äù until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This
frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run
simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

_C_r_a_y designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a
multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and
powerful machines such as _s_u_p_e_r_c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s, _m_a_i_n_f_r_a_m_e_ _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s and _s_e_r_v_e_r_s.
Multiprocessor and _m_u_l_t_i_-_c_o_r_e (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit)
personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being
increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.
Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ
significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general
purpose computers._[_5_6_] They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-
speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to
be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program
organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources
at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale _s_i_m_u_l_a_t_i_o_n, _g_r_a_p_h_i_c_s

Visualization of a portion of the _r_o_u_t_e_s on the Internet
Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations
since the 1950s. The U.S. military's _S_A_G_E system was the first large-scale
example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial
systems such as _S_a_b_r_e._[_5_7_]
In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United
States began to link their computers together using telecommunications
technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now _D_A_R_P_A), and the _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _n_e_t_w_o_r_k
that resulted was called the _A_R_P_A_N_E_T._[_5_8_] The technologies that made the
Arpanet possible spread and evolved.
In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and
became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a
redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating
systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and
access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral
devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an
individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to
people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of
applications like e-mail and the _W_o_r_l_d_ _W_i_d_e_ _W_e_b, combined with the development
of cheap, fast networking technologies like _E_t_h_e_r_n_e_t and _A_D_S_L saw computer
networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are
networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal
computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive
information. ‚ÄúWireless‚Äù networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks,
has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile
computing environments.

The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called _p_r_o_g_r_a_m_s makes
computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from _c_a_l_c_u_l_a_t_o_r_s. The

  40. _^^ The Intel 4004 (1971) die was 12 mm2, composed of 2300 transistors; by
      comparison, the Pentium Pro was 306 mm2, composed of 5.5 million
      transistors, according to Patterson, David; Hennessy, John (1998),

  42. _^^ It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer
      oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental
      problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For
      instance, the _P_e_n_t_i_u_m_ _F_D_I_V_ _b_u_g caused some _I_n_t_e_l _m_i_c_r_o_p_r_o_c_e_s_s_o_r_s in the
      early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain _f_l_o_a_t_i_n_g_ _p_o_i_n_t
      division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor
      design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.

  44. _^^ Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine
      code. Some _m_i_n_i_c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_s like the _D_E_C _P_D_P_-_8 could be programmed directly
      from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as
      part of the _b_o_o_t_i_n_g process. Most modern computers boot entirely
      automatically by reading a boot program from some _n_o_n_-_v_o_l_a_t_i_l_e_ _m_e_m_o_r_y.
  45. _^^ However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility
      between different computers. An _x_8_6_-_6_4 compatible microprocessor like the
      _A_M_D _A_t_h_l_o_n_ _6_4 is able to run most of the same programs that an _I_n_t_e_l_ _C_o_r_e
      _2 microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier
      microprocessors like the Intel _P_e_n_t_i_u_m_s and _I_n_t_e_l_ _8_0_4_8_6. This contrasts
      with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and
      totally incompatible with other computers.
  46. _^^ High level languages are also often _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_d rather than compiled.
      Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while
      running, by another program called an _i_n_t_e_r_p_r_e_t_e_r.
  47. _^^ The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied
      somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for
      instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always
      the case. Many computers include some instructions that may only be
      partially interpreted by the control system and partially interpreted by
      another device. This is especially the case with specialized computing
      hardware that may be partially self-contained. For example, _E_D_V_A_C, one of
      the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that
      only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related
      instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded
      there.
  48. _^^ Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the
      program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations
      required to store one instruction.

      before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage.

  56. _^^ However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many
      pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers
      connected by networks. These so-called _c_o_m_p_u_t_e_r_ _c_l_u_s_t_e_r_s can often
      provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized
      designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most
      powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster
      computers in recent years. (_T_O_P_5_0_0_ _2_0_0_6)
